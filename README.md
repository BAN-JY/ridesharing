# ridesharing
Simulation model for evaluating highway lane management withrideshare vehicles

## Introduction
To promote ridesharing to mitigate traffic congestion, it is necessary to propose an effective policy to stimulate commuters to shift to ridesharing. In this study, we build a simulation model to evaluate the effect of the different charges of toll policies on the High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lane. Through numerical experiments, four evaluation indicators including total revenue, total number of drivers, rideshare utilization and total travel time are evaluated to determine what is the most effective toll. In the result, we found the optimum toll which is determined as the most effective toll for HOT lanes.
